# Amazon AI-Driven Operations Automation Platform

**Project Framework:** Hybrid (Waterfall + Agile)  
**Project Type:** Enterprise AI Automation & Operational Transformation

---

## Project Overview

This project is an independent, end-to-end hybrid project management and product delivery case study focused on implementing AI-driven automation across large-scale operational workflows.

The initiative explores how AI-powered systems (chatbots, predictive analytics, and workflow automation) can improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance decision-making across complex enterprise environments.

---

## Business Problem

Large-scale operations face persistent challenges, including:

- High manual effort across repetitive operational tasks
- Delays in issue resolution and customer interactions
- Limited real-time visibility into operational performance
- Inefficient escalation and resource allocation
- Scalability constraints during peak demand periods

These issues lead to increased costs, slower response times, operational bottlenecks, and reduced customer satisfaction.

---

## Proposed Solution (High-Level)

Design and implement an AI-enabled operations automation platform that:

- Uses AI chatbots for first-level issue handling and support
- Applies predictive analytics for demand forecasting and anomaly detection
- Automates operational workflows and escalations
- Provides real-time dashboards for operational insights
- Combines structured planning with iterative delivery for AI components
- Scales reliably across high-volume enterprise environments

---

## Framework Selection

A **Hybrid (Waterfall + Agile)** approach was selected due to:

- Large upfront architectural and compliance requirements
- Need for structured planning and phased rollout
- AI model components requiring iterative experimentation
- Multiple stakeholder groups across operations, tech, and leadership
- Risk management and governance needs at enterprise scale

---

## My Role

Acted as **Project Manager / Product Delivery Lead**

- Defined project scope, milestones, and success metrics
- Designed hybrid delivery model and governance structure
- Coordinated cross-functional teams (Operations, Engineering, Data, QA)
- Managed risk, dependencies, and change control
- Oversaw AI implementation phases and sprint execution
- Tracked delivery progress, KPIs, and operational outcomes
